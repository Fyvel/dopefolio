						<p class="project-details__desc-para">
							The Healthy Serve is a Progressive Web App (PWA) that I built for a friend. The app allows
							the owner to securely upload a wide range of recipes, which are then made available to users
							on their desktop, tablet, or mobile devices. To ensure that users can easily find what
							they're looking for, the recipes are searchable using Algolia search and facets, which
							provide a powerful search experience.
						</p>
						<p class="project-details__desc-para">
							The app features secure authentication for the owner, which allows for adding, editing, or
							deleting recipes as needed. This ensures that only authorized users have access to the
							recipe management functionality.
						</p>
						<p class="project-details__desc-para">
							In addition, the app optimizes images to ensure they are efficiently fetched and displayed
							in the frontend. This is achieved through a process that resizes images to an optimal size,
							which not only reduces the amount of data that needs to be transferred but also ensures that
							the images are displayed correctly across devices.
